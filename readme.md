Codepath iOS Week 4 - Twitter client

Completed all required stories. Current implementation has poor use of notificaitons (e.g. we pass from tableview cell -> tableview controller -> sidebar view controller). I'm sure there's a way to make this more efficeint, but I'm on a plane with no wifi, so I got it working. Hopefully I will have time to fix this.

Hours spent: ~10
